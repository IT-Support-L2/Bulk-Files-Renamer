# Bulk-Files-Renamer

Bulk Files Renamer allows you to rename thousands files in few seconds only! Thanks to Python threading technique.


- tkinter GUI drawn with PAGE but I modified most part of the generated code.

- Developed with Python 3.9.0


To successfully compile the code into Windows executable, while you are in the BulkFileRenamer.py directory run:

```
pyinstaller --noconsole BulkFileRenamer.py
```
